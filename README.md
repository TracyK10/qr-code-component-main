## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my knowledge of responsive design using media queries. I ensured that the layout adapts well to both mobile and desktop screens. Below is a sample of the media query used for responsive design:

```css
/* Mobile view */
@media (max-width: 375px) {
    body {
        font-size: 14px;
    }

    .content {
        padding: 0 10px;
    }
}

/* Desktop view */
@media (min-width: 1440px) {
    body {
        font-size: 16px;
    }

    .content {
        padding: 0 20px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus more on:
- Advanced CSS techniques
- Improving accessibility
- Implementing more complex layouts with CSS Grid

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This resource helped me understand how to use media queries effectively for responsive design.
